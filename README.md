# EasternKidsSavePlans
Hello everyone, 
I am a child who grew up in East Asian culture. 
In my community, an increasing number of children are suffering from depression due to the overwhelming flow of information,
excessive societal and academic pressures—it’s truly heartbreaking.
Growing up in such a culture, 
I understand how these factors can destroy the most vital part of a person—their zest for life. In the life of an East Asian child, 
there is no gap year,
no societal outlets for emotional release, 
nor verbal support from parents.
I want to create a free platform where everyone can build communities based on their interests.
Here, you can make friends online or post to express your emotions.
